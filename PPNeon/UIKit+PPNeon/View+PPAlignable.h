 *  @param padding The padding to be applied between this view and the sibling view, which is applied differently depending on the `Align` specified. For example, if aligning `.ToTheRightOfMatchingTop` the padding is used to adjust the x origin of this view so it sits to the right of the sibling view, while the y origin is automatically calculated to match the sibling view.
 *  @param width   The width of the view.
